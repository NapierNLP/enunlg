## Meaning Representations

We aim to use `mr`, `MR`, or `meaning representation` as a broad super category for the different kinds of input representations that we use which are intended to specify the content of a text, whether or not it is aligned ot a particular theory of meaning or semantics.

We use `sv` or `slot-value pairs` or `SlotValueMR` to refer to meaning representations which consist of keys paired with values.

Types of MR
- Slot-Value
- RDFTriples
