Models
======

We recommend creating directories for your different models here based on the naming convention:

    YYYY-MM-DD_MODEL_DETAILS/
	
Make sure you include a `README.md` for your future reference in each of those directories as well.

# File format

Currently we're just using `torch.save()` to save the state dicts for models to files.
